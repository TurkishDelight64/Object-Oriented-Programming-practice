# Object-Oriented-Programming-practice
I am practicing what I am learning from a course about C# that includes OOP fundamentals 

I build a small system in which a company can add new employees. Thats it. Its very simple.

THe 2 files I have are the files I used for my practice. Employee.cs is my class that I used to add new employees. Program.cs is where I made new object i.e. added
new employees and played around with them.

Enjoy!
